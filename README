nzbmatrix_cli
=============

An attempt at a perl CLI nzbmatrix download using nzbmatrix API 

Designed for Linux in mind; might be able to use it in windows with some tinkering

**Must install Curses::UI from CPAN

**Also must have wget installed

Sorry the code is messy and is not well commented

To run the program make it executable (chmod +x nzbmatrix) then use ./nzbmatrix_cli

Alternatively you can put it in one of your path folders e.g. /usr/local/bin and then run it from anywhere

with nzbmatrix


Main Shortcut Keys:

ctrl + s = search

ctrl + d = download

When entering the download number you may use the search result # i.e. 1 or 6 does not have to be the whole ID but it could be

Can only do one download at a time, may try to change this in the future
