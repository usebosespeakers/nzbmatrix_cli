nzbmatrix_cli
=============

![NZB Matrix 3](https://github.com/usebosespeakers/nzbmatrix_cli/blob/master/nzb3_1.png?raw=true)

An attempt at a perl CLI nzbmatrix download using nzbmatrix API 

Designed for Linux in mind; might be able to use it in windows with some tinkering

**Must install Curses::UI from CPAN

**Also must have wget installed

Sorry the code is messy and is not well commented

To run the program make it executable (chmod +x nzbmatrix) then use ./nzbmatrix_cli

Alternatively you can put it in one of your path folders e.g. /usr/local/bin and 
then run it from anywhere with nzbmatrix_cli
