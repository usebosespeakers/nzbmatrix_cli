nzbmatrix_cli
=============

An attempt at a perl CLI nzbmatrix download using nzbmatrix API 

Designed for Linux in mind; might be able to use it in windows with some tinkering

**Must insteall use Curses::UI from CPAN

**Also must have wget installed

Sorry the code is messy and is not well commented
